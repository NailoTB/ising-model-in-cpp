# Ising model simulator in C++
A simple Ising model simulator made in C++. Made for lattice method practice and to store my common plotting scripts.

Can be run simply by running

./runAll.sh

The script compiles the simulator, runs it and creates an animation. The simulation is not seeded, every run is different.
