# Ising model simulator in C++
A simple Ising model simulator made in C++. Made for lattice method practice and to store my common plotting scripts.

Can be run simply by running
```
./runAll.sh
```
The script compiles the simulator, runs it and creates an animation. The initial state is seeded. The spin-flip algorithm is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

To do: Make dynamic temperature. More refactoring. Explain physics.
