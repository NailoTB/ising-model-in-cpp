# Ising model simulator in C++
A simple Ising model simulator made in C++. Made for lattice method practice and to store my common plotting scripts.

Can be run simply by running
```
./runAll.sh
```
The script compiles the simulator, runs it and creates an animation. The simulation is not seeded thus every run is different.

Default settings have external magnetic field on so one spin will dominate. 

To do: Add magnetization plots. Make dynamic temperature.
